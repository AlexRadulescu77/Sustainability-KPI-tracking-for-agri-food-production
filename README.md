# Sustainability KPI Tracking for Dairy Production

This project simulates how a dairy production company can monitor environmental and operational sustainability using structured KPIs and business intelligence tools.

The objective was to design a decision-support dashboard that allows management to compare facilities, products, and seasonal performance using measurable sustainability indicators.

The solution follows a structured analytics workflow:

Python → SQL → Power BI

## Business Context

Companies in Denmark operate under increasing ESG and sustainability requirements.  
However, environmental data is often collected but not transformed into structured, comparable KPIs.

This project demonstrates how operational production data can be converted into decision-ready sustainability metrics.

## Overall Sustainability Performance

- Total CO₂ emissions: 212,000 kg  
- Average CO₂ per unit: 0.37 kg  
- Average energy per unit: 3.30  
- Average water per unit: 7.59  
- Average waste per unit: 0.06  

Per-unit normalization enables fair comparison across products and facilities.

## Facility Benchmarking

Efficiency comparison across plants:

- Copenhagen Plant – highest performance  
- Aarhus Plant – second  
- Odense Plant – moderate  
- Aalborg Plant – lowest efficiency  

This highlights measurable operational performance gaps.

## Product-Level Insights

- Cheese products account for 36% of total CO₂ emissions  
- Blue Cheese shows the highest CO₂ and energy intensity  
- Yogurt and Milk products demonstrate higher efficiency scores  
- Regular Yogurt and Whole Milk are among the most efficient products per unit  

This supports product portfolio sustainability evaluation.

## Seasonal Patterns

CO₂ emissions fluctuate between approximately 11,500 kg and 15,000 kg (2021–2024), indicating seasonal operational impact on environmental performance.
